							<h3>Buffer Overflow Exploits</h3>
							<p>
								The buffer overflow exploit techniques a hacker uses depends on the architecture and operating system being used by their target. However, the extra data they issue to a program will likely contain malicious code that enables the attacker to trigger additional actions and send new instructions to the application. 
								For example, introducing additional code into a program could send it new instructions that give the attacker access to the organization’s IT systems. In the event that an attacker knows a program’s memory layout, they may be able to intentionally input data that cannot be stored by the buffer. This will enable them to overwrite memory locations that store executable code and replace it with malicious code that allows them to take control of the program.<br/>
								Attackers use a buffer overflow to corrupt a web application’s execution stack, execute arbitrary code, and take over a machine. Flaws in buffer overflows can exist in both application servers and web servers, especially web applications that use libraries like graphics libraries. Buffer overflows can also exist in custom web application codes. This is more likely because they are given less scrutiny by security teams but are less likely to be discovered by hackers and more difficult to exploit.

							<h2>Which Programming Languages Are More Vulnerable?</h2>
							<p>
								Nearly all applications, web servers, and web application environments are vulnerable to buffer overflows. Environments that are written in interpreted languages, such as Java and Python, are immune to the attacks, with the exception of overflows in their interpreter.<br/>
								Buffer overflow attacks are typically caused by coding errors and mistakes in application development. This results in buffer overflow as the application does not allocate appropriately sized buffers and fails to check for overflow issues. These issues are particularly problematic in the programming language C/C++ as it does not have buffer overflow protection built in.<br/>
								This programming language is not the only one vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. A buffer overflow program in Assembly, C, C++ or Fortran is also particularly vulnerable and more likely to enable attackers to compromise a system. However, applications written in JavaScript or Perl are typically less vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.
