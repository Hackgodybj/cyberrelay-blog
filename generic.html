									<p>The Blue Team identifies security threats and risks in the operating environment, and in cooperation with the customer, analyzes the network environment and its current state of security readiness.<br />

								<p>If the red team is playing offense, then the blue team is on defense. Typically, this group consists of incident response consultants who provide guidance to the IT security team on where to make improvements to stop sophisticated types of cyberattacks and threats. The IT security team is then responsible for maintaining the internal network against various types of risk.
								While many organizations consider prevention the gold standard of security, detection and remediation are equally important to overall defense capabilities. One key metric is the organization’s “breakout time” — the critical window between when an intruder compromises the first machine and when they can move laterally to other systems on the network.</p><br / >
								<p>A skilled cyber security blue team can play a critical role in helping to develop a comprehensive plan for organizational defense using the latest tools and techniques — a “blue team security stack,” in other words. Often, it’s best to think of them as the most active contingent of a security team.
								Not all security team personnel specialize in tasks that are considered to be high-level or relevant enough for testing. Blue teams are focused on high-level threats and are dedicated to continuous improvement in detection and response techniques.
								To succeed, blue teams must be rigorously thorough after all, red teams can launch 99 unsuccessful attacks and still win on the 100th attempt. Blue teams must be right all the time. In addition to attention to detail, blue teams must also think creatively and have the ability to adapt on the fly. This is because many of the most effective red teamers (and black hat hackers) are remarkably adept at formulating novel and hard-to-predict attack techniques.
								By evaluating the work of both red and blue teams, organizations can develop a holistic picture of the state of their security — and make any changes that may be required to ensure a robust overall defense.</p>
